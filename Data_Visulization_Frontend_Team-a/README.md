# Security Operations Dashboard for Threat Detection with Risk Mitigation Analytics

An enterprise-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard engineered for real-time cyber threat detection, predictive anomaly analytics, and multi-factor risk mitigation intelligence.

---

## 🛡️ Project Overview

**Security Operations Dashboard for Threat Detection with Risk Mitigation Analytics** provides cybersecurity analysts and operations teams with continuous telemetry monitoring, explainable AI (XAI) threat classification, and actionable risk mitigation insights across enterprise network perimeters.

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Continuous ingestion, audit logging, and severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for network security events.
- **Risk Mitigation Analytics:** 5-factor risk scoring engine evaluating threat likelihood, vulnerability impact, asset criticality, attack surface exposure, and historical mitigation factors.
- **Machine Learning & Anomaly Prediction:** Unsupervised Isolation Forest model anomaly inference and confidence radial gauges for zero-day threat detection.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Attribution:** Detailed factor contribution checklists breaking down why specific security events triggered alert thresholds (e.g., impossible travel, brute-force frequency, off-hours access).
- **Incident Investigation & Response Playbooks:** Comprehensive triage workspace with downloadable PDF/print incident analysis reports and automated mitigation playbooks.
- **Global Attack Vectors & Heatmap:** Interactive geographic threat origin visualization and timeline telemetry tracking.
- **Cyber AI Core Diagnostics:** Live system health telemetry, neural inference response metrics, and synthesized alert indicators.

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** or **bun**

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` or `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
PORT=5000
